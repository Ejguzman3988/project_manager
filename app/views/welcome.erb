    Project Manager is an app where a user can sign up and create projects. These projects will have titles, images, to-do lists, and a checklist for research. A user will have name, username, password, and many projects. A project will have Name, description, image, to-do list, and a research checklist. Also the project will belong to a user. This app is a quick an easy way to organize projects with other people and help keep a database of the projects structure and research. It is way too hard to get ideas off the ground, this app helps bridge that while providing an easy to use interface.
